# Diversity-Inclusion Analysis (By using Power BI)
This Power BI project analyzes workforce diversity and inclusion metrics to uncover representation, promotion, and retention patterns across job levels and demographic segments. It integrates employee data segmented by gender, age group, job role, and performance rating to deliver interactive dashboards for HR and executive insights. The dashboards highlight key indicators such as gender distribution in hiring and promotions, turnover rates, average performance ratings, and time-in-grade across leadership levels. Visualizations include bar charts, donut charts, heat maps, and trend lines, enabling deep exploration of equity across organizational layers. The solution empowers data-driven decision-making to advance inclusive workplace practices and leadership diversity.

## Objectives of the project
1) To track and visualize workforce diversity metrics across gender, age groups, and job levels using key indicators such as hiring ratios, promotion rates, and turnover percentages.
2) To assess gender balance and equity in promotions, performance ratings, and average time-in-grade across hierarchical levels within the organization.
3) To identify underrepresented groups in leadership and monitor their progression through different job levels to support targeted inclusion strategies.
4) To analyze demographic patterns such as age distribution and gender-based attrition, enabling proactive workforce planning and retention initiatives.
5) To deliver actionable insights via interactive Power BI dashboards, empowering HR and leadership teams to make data-driven decisions for fostering an inclusive workplace culture.

   
## Questions solved 
1) What is the gender distribution across the organization, and how does it vary by job level?
2) What percentage of hires and promotions were female vs. male across different roles?
3) What are the turnover rates by gender, and which groups have the highest attrition?
4) How do average performance ratings compare between genders and between leavers vs. non-leavers?
5) What is the distribution of employees across different age groups and job levels?
6) How long (on average) do promoted employees stay in their roles before advancing?
7) Which job levels show the most or least gender diversity in hiring and promotions?
8) Are there observable trends in diversity performance year over year?
9) How inclusive is the promotion pipeline for underrepresented groups at senior levels?
10) What are the key gaps or disparities in representation that require strategic attention?

## Final Observations & Storyline
The organizational talent ecosystem reflects a youthful workforce, with 215 employees aged 20–29 and 161 aged 30–39, together forming 78% of the base. Junior Officers (160) dominate headcount, accounting for 94.67% of the 20–29 age group, yet suffer the highest turnover at 53.43%. Gender hiring is nearly balanced—51.5% female vs 48.5% male—yet promotion rates show disparity: only 25% of females were promoted vs 64.3% of their male peers at the same junior level. Average time in grade for promotions varies widely—from 1.80 years for Senior Managers to 3.40 years for Directors—highlighting bottlenecks at the top. Performance ratings show a narrow gender gap (2.42 for women vs 2.41 for men), but female leavers had slightly higher attrition (11.2%) than men (9.3%). Notably, performance ratings among leavers were consistently lower than non-leavers across levels, signaling disengagement before exit. Promotion trends are skewed at senior levels—only 2.9% female promotions at Director level vs 25% at Junior Officer level—indicating a glass ceiling. Among the 87 FY21 promotions, average performance hovered around mid-scale (Rating 3), suggesting moderate growth culture. Overall, the data paints a picture of a young, diverse but hierarchically rigid workforce with evident gaps in gender equity and upward mobility.
